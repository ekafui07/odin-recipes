🍽️ About the Project

This is one of my first HTML-only projects. The goal was to:
- Practice using HTML structure and tags
- Create multiple interlinked pages
- Display content in a clean and readable way




🔨 Tools Used

- HTML5
- Git & GitHub
- Visual Studio Code (VS Code)



📸 Features

- A homepage listing recipe links
- Individual pages for each recipe, with:
  - Ingredients
  - Step-by-step cooking instructions
  - Simple formatting for readability



📚 What I Learned

- Writing clean and valid HTML
- Linking between pages using anchor (`<a>`) tags
- Using lists, headings, paragraphs, and images



🚀 Next Steps

- Add CSS for better styling
- Improve layout and formatting
- Add more recipes (Ghanaian dishes especially!)
- Try hosting with GitHub Pages
